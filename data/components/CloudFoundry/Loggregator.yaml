      g: "- 18F uses Steno for Cloud Foundry account logging. Steno is a shared logging\
        \ service between the DEA, Cloud Controller and Cloud Foundry components that\
        \ share a common interface for configuring logs. \n- Loggregator also referred\
        \ to as Doppler in newer versions of cf, is the Cloud Foundry component responsible\
        \ for logging, and provides a stream of log output from 18F applications and\
        \ from Cloud Foundry system components that interact with applications during\
        \ updates and execution. Loggregator allows users to:\n  - Tail their application\
        \ logs.\n  - Dump a recent set of application logs (where recent is a configurable\
        \ number of log packets).\n  - Continually drain their application logs to\
        \ 3rd party log archive and analysis services (i.e Splunk, Syslog, Alien Vault\
        \ USM).\n  - (Operators and administrators only) Access the firehose, which\
        \ includes the combined stream of logs from all apps, plus metrics data from\
        \ CF components\n- Syslog and Syslog_aggregator are used for system logging\
        \ and provide a mechanism to forward system logs via syslog to a syslog server.\n\
        - /healthz and /varz are HTTP endpoints provided by Cloud Foundry components\
        \ used for system monitoring. The endpoints can be polled to obtain information\
        \ on a job\u2019s health and state. \n  - /healthz is a basic check that returns\
        \ an \u2018ok\u2019 message if the job\u2019s running happily.\n  - /varz\
        \ provides more detailed information about the running job. For example, polling\
        \ /varz on the uaa server returns data about java memory usage (amongst other\
        \ things).\n- The Collector is used for monitoring and metrics by collecting\
        \ data from the /health and /var endpoints. It dynamically learns about Cloud\
        \ Foundry components and polls them for monitoring data and provides options\
        \ to send monitoring data to AWS CloudWatch, Datadog, graphite and TSDB.\n\
        - New components have been added to the most recent version of Cloud Foundry\
        \ \n  - CF components emit metrics (e.g. the router emits HTTP metrics, such\
        \ as the time taken to service a request).\n  - These metrics are sent to\
        \ agents running on the VMs called \u2018metron\u2019.\n  - The metron agents\
        \ forward these metrics, along with application logs, to \u2018doppler\u2019\
        \ servers.\n  - The doppler servers collect and buffer the data.\n  - The\
        \ loggregator traffic controllers expose a new websocket endpoint \u2018/firehose\u2019\
        .\n  - When you connect to /firehose, a connection is opened up to all doppler\
        \ servers.\n  - All logs and metrics for all apps and components are then\
        \ streamed down the connection.\n"

        - Loggregator, the Cloud Foundry component responsible for logging, provides
        a stream of log output from 18F applications and from Cloud Foundry system
        components that interact with your app during updates and execution.

        - By default, Loggregator streams logs to a terminal. 18F will drain logs
        to a third-party log management service such as AlienVault USM and AWS Cloudtrail.

        - Cloud Foundry gathers and stores logs in a best-effort manner. If a client
        is unable to consume log lines quickly enough, the Loggregator buffer may
        need to overwrite some lines before the client has consumed them. a syslog
        drain or a CLI tail can usually keep up with the flow of application logs.
