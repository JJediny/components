  NIST-800-53:
    CM-2: '- Linux instances are based on the standard AWS AMI images with configuration
      to GSA requirements based on secure configurations documented in CM-6.

      - AlienVault USM for AWS is provided by the vendor as a secure hardened AMI
      image that is deployed using a cloudformation template.

      - NIST guidance, best practices, CIS benchmarks along with standard and hardened
      Operating System AMIs have been utilized.

      - DevOps maintain copies of the latest Production Software Baseline, which includes
      the following elements: Manufacturer, Type, Version number, Software, Databases,
      and Stats.

    CM-6:
      a: '- DevOps and Security Engineers maintain the baseline configuration for
        VPC, EBS and AMIs.  Best practices, FISMA compliant AMIs, and hardened cloud
        formation templates are utilized as there are no benchmarks available.

        - The organization uses FISMA compliant and hardened AMIs within its AWS infrastructure

    RA-5:
      a: '- 18F runs Nessus (Authenticated) scans of the Cloud Foundry environment
        weekly based on IP ranges in use. These scans include network discovery and
        vulnerability checks of operating systems, server software, and any supporting
        components or applications. Scans are automatically compared to previous scans
        to identify new vulnerabilities or changes which resolve previously identified
        vulnerabilities. Nessus reports are reviewed at least weekly and appropriate
        actions taken on discovery of vulnerabilities.

        - Nessus is used to run (Authenticated) scans when a new host/AMI/Stemcell
        is built.  This scan determines baseline posture used to contribute to decision
        of Production acceptance.  Additionally, this tool is used to execute CIS
        benchmark compliance scans when actively working to address configuration
        and hardening requirements.

        - OWASP Zap is used to conduct web Application scanning primarily for the
        OWASP Top 10. 18F uses it as an integrated security testing tool for finding
        vulnerabilities in web applications. 18F will provide more automated functionally
        of security tests using OWASP ZAP and Jenkins for its  software development
        lifecycle and continuous integration functions

        - AlienVault USM for AWS runs AWS friendly Authenticated vulnerability scans
        within the 18F AWS infrastructure and does not require permission from AWS
        to run scan within its Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

        '
    SI-4:
      a: '- All Cloud Foundry EC2 instances will be monitored for attacks and unauthorized
        connections through Alienvault USM

        - AlienVault USM collects and aggregates various audit logs and alerts based
        on abnormal activity or attacks.
