      a: '- Access to Amazon EC2 Linux instances are managed by the use of EC2 key
        pairs and using SSH to access the local instance on the individual Linux,
        or appliance instance. Account types include individual user and system/application
        user accounts. Shared or group accounts are not permitted outside of default
        accounts such as local Administrators or root. There are no guest/anonymous
        or temporary user accounts.

        - Operating System user groups are documented in section 9.1 Types of Users.

        - Initial Linux local root access is provided to AWS administrator account
        users only if they provide the key pair assigned to the Linux EC2 instance
        and login using SSH.

        '
      f: '- Local system user account establishment, activation, modification, disablement
        or removal requires approval by the managing 18F project lead and Cloud Foundry
        Information System Technical Point of Contact (Operating Environment).

      g: '- 18F has implemented AWS CloudWatch for basic monitoring of Amazon EC2
        instances. Basic Monitoring for Amazon EC2 instances: Seven pre-selected metrics
        at five-minute frequency and three status check metrics at one-minute frequency.

        - 18F has implemented Detailed Monitoring for Amazon EC2 instances: All metrics
        available to Basic Monitoring at one-minute frequency. Instances with Detailed
        Monitoring enabled allow data aggregation by Amazon EC2 AMI ID and instance
        type.

        - 18F has implemented the use of Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing where
        Amazon CloudWatch provides Amazon EC2 instance metrics aggregated by Auto
        Scaling groups and Elastic Load Balancers.

        - Monitoring data is retained for two weeks, even if AWS resources have been
        terminated. This enables 18F to quickly look back at the metrics preceding
        an event of interest.

        - Metrics are accessed in either the Amazon EC2 tab or the Amazon CloudWatch
        tab of the AWS Management Console, or by using the Amazon CloudWatch API.

        of notification of an email from the managing 18F project lead or at a future
        date as directed.

        90 days of inactivity.

      i: '- System access to local EC2 instance accounts is provided only to those
        with an established need to manage servers in the Cloud Foundry environment.

        - Linux accounts will be monitored via scripts which query the last logon
        date/time of each user account and provide the results in the form of a CSV
        file which an authorized administrator will use for the basis of disablement.

        - Application accounts will be monitored monthly and accounts will be disabled
        after 90 days of inactivity; this will be a manual review process, but the
        disablement will be automatic.

      a: '- 18F has implemented AWS CloudTrail for monitoring Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS,
        and Amazon VPC that captures API calls and delivers the log files to an Amazon
        S3 bucket. By default, all CloudTrail log files are encrypted by using Amazon
        S3 server-side encryption (SSE)

        - With CloudTrail logging enabled, API calls made to Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS,
        and Amazon VPC actions are tracked in log files, along with any other AWS
        service records. CloudTrail determines when to create and write to a new file
        based on a specified time period and file size.

    CM-2: DevOps maintain baseline configurations for VPC, EBS, EC2 instances and
      AMIs. AWS Cloud Formation templates help 18F maintain a strict configuration
      management scheme of the cloud infrastructure. If an error or misconfiguration
      of the infrastructure or associated security mechanism (security groups, NACLs)
      is detected, the administrators can analyze the current infrastructure templates;
      compare with previous versions, and redeploy the configurations to a known and
      approved state.
    CM-8:
      a: '- AWS Config provides a detailed inventory of all 18F AWS resources and
        their current configuration, and continuously records configuration changes
        (e.g., the value of tags on Amazon EC2 instances, ingress/egress rules of
        security groups, and Network ACL rules for VPCs).

    IA-2 (1): '- Although the EC2 instances do not natively have a MFA mechanism,

    IA-2 (12): '- Although the EC2 instances do not utilize PIV credentials, Agency
      privileged/non-privilege users need to first log into GSA GFEs and network using

        \ AMIs automatically generate new SSH host certificates on first boot and\
        \ log them to the instance\u2019s console. 18F can then use the secure APIs\
