  NIST-800-53:
    CM-3:
      a: '- 18F uses several version control systems(i.e. AWS Config, AWS Service
        Catalog) with its templates to know exactly what changes were made, who made
        them, and when. If at any point 18F needs to reverse changes to infrastructure,
        you can use a previous version of a template.

        '
      c: '- For changes related to the AWS infrastructure, 18F uses AWS Service Catalog,
        AWS Config, VisualOps and AlienVault USM for AWS for real-time configuration
        changes which are documented, approved and tracked within GitHub.

        '
    CM-8:
      a: '- AWS Config provides a detailed inventory of all 18F AWS resources and
        their current configuration, and continuously records configuration changes
        (e.g., the value of tags on Amazon EC2 instances, ingress/egress rules of
        security groups, and Network ACL rules for VPCs).

        - Using AWS Config, 18F can export a complete inventory of AWS resources with
        all configuration details, determine how a resource was configured at any
        point in time, and get notified via Amazon SNS when the configuration of a
        resource changes.

        - AWS Config can provide configuration snapshots, which is a point-in-time
        capture of all 18F resources and their configurations. Configuration snapshots
        are generated on demand via the AWS CLI, or API, and delivered to an Amazon
        S3 bucket that is specified
