      a: "- 18F has implemented AWS CloudTrail for its account monitoring. It provides\
        \ visibility into user activity by recording API calls made on an AWS account.\
        \ CloudTrail records important information about each API call, including\
        \ the name of the API, the identity of the caller, the time of the API call,\
        \ the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the AWS service.\
        \ This information helps 18F track changes made to its AWS resources and to\
        \ troubleshoot operational issues.  \n- CloudTrail delivers API call information\
        \ by depositing log files in an Amazon S3 bucket.  Each log file can contain\
        \ multiple events, and each event represents an API call.\n"
      d: "- 18F has implemented AWS CloudTrail for monitoring Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS,\
        \ and Amazon VPC that captures API calls and delivers the log files to an\
        \ Amazon S3 bucket. By default, all CloudTrail  log files are encrypted by\
        \ using Amazon S3 server-side encryption (SSE)\n- When CloudTrail logging\
        \ is enabled, API calls made to Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon VPC actions\
        \ are tracked in log files, along with any other AWS service records. CloudTrail\
        \ determines when to create and write to a new file based on a specified time\
        \ period and file size.\n- Every log entry contains information about who\
        \ generated the request. The user identity information in the log helps  determine\
        \ whether the request was made with root or IAM user credentials, with temporary\
        \ security credentials for a role or federated user, or by another AWS service.\
        \ \n- CloudTrail publish Amazon SNS notifications when new log files are delivered\
        \ for 18F staff to review upon log file delivery.\n"
