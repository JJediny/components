  NIST-800-53:
    CM-2: '- DevOps maintain baseline configurations for VPC, EBS, EC2 instances and
      AMIs. AWS Cloud Formation templates help 18F maintain a strict configuration
      management scheme of the cloud infrastructure. If an error or misconfiguration
      of the infrastructure or associated security mechanism (security groups, NACLs)
      is detected, the administrators can analyze the current infrastructure templates;
      compare with previous versions, and redeploy the configurations to a known and
      approved state.

      - AWS Cloud Formation templates are the approved baseline for all changes to
      the infrastructure and simplify provisioning and management on AWS. They provide
      an automated method to assess the status of an operational infrastructure against
      an approved baseline.

      '
    CM-3: '- 18F provisions its infrastructure with AWS CloudFormation, the AWS CloudFormation
      template describes exactly what resources are provisioned and their settings.
      Because these templates are text files, 18F can simply track differences in
      these templates to track changes to its infrastructure, similar to the way developers
      control revisions to source code.

      - 18F uses several version control systems(i.e. AWS Config, AWS Service Catalog)
      with its templates to know exactly what changes were made, who made them, and
      when. If at any point 18F needs to reverse changes to infrastructure, you can
      use a previous version of a template.
