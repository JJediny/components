  NIST-800-53:
    CA-8: For internal penetration testing inside 18 F's Virtual Private Cloud, 18F
      team members will conduct authenticated vulnerability scans using Nessus, whitebox/greybox
      testing of the 18F environment using AWS friendly and approved assessment tools.
    CM-6:
      d: "Nessus and AlienVault USM Joval scans are performed at least on a quarterly\
        \ basis in the event that no enhancements or upgrades are performed. Both\
        \ tools meet NIST\u2019s SCAP 1.2 requirements, satisfying OMB Mandate M-08-22\
        \ and associated procurement requirements. SCAP scans are performed weekly\
        \ and monthly to ensure no unauthorized changes, enhancements or upgrades\
        \ are performed."
    RA-5:
      a: '- Nessus will be used conduct internal scanning of its VPC and private subnets
        within the 18F Virtual Private Cloud.

        - 18F runs Nessus (Authenticated) scans of the Cloud Foundry environment weekly
        based on IP ranges in use. These scans include network discovery and vulnerability
        checks of operating systems, server software, and any supporting components
        or applications. Scans are automatically compared to previous scans to identify
        new vulnerabilities or changes which resolve previously identified vulnerabilities.
        Nessus reports are reviewed at least weekly and appropriate actions taken
        on discovery of vulnerabilities.

        - Nessus is used to run (Authenticated) scans when a new host/AMI/Stemcell
        is built.  This scan determines baseline posture used to contribute to decision
        of Production acceptance.  Additionally, this tool is used to execute CIS
        benchmark compliance scans when actively working to address configuration
        and hardening requirements.

        '
      b: '- Nessus, and AlienVault USM for AWS utilize tools and techniques that promote
        interoperability such as Common Vulnerability Scoring System v2 (CVSS2), Common
        Platform Enumeration (CPE), and Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE). Tenable
        SecurityCenter is able to output reports in CyberScope format to meet NIST,
        DHS, and GSA reporting requirements.

        '
      c: '- AlienVault USM for AWS, OWASP Zap and Tenable Nessus reports are reviewed
        and analyzed at least weekly and appropriate actions taken on discovery of
        vulnerabilities within the 18F Cloud Infrastructure and applications and from
        security control assessments conducted on its information systems.

        '
    SI-2:
      a: '- Flaw identification is accomplished via Nessus, AlienVault USM, OWASP
        Zap, and Code Climate static code analysis.  Nessus is a vulnerability, configuration,
        and compliance scanner.
